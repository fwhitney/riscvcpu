# About
My repository for my single-cycle and multi-cycle cpu implementations in Verilog!
Each CPU supports the RV32I instruction set.
The implementations are based on the diagram(s) provided in the textbook: Digital Design and Computer Architecture RISC-V Edition by Sarah L. Harris and David Harris.

Keep in mind I taught myself Verilog, so these implementations may not be using quite the best practices. 

# Single-Cycle CPU:
This implementation is complete! This CPU implementation can be thrown into whatever hardware simulator you want and should run perfectly! This implementation I have been working on in the beginning and latter half of this year.

# Multi-Cycle CPU:
This implementation is not complete. It is what I'm working on currently over the next 2 months.
